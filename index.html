            <p>
                Hi! My name is <strong>Justin Alarcio</strong>, and I‚Äôm currently a second-year 
                <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong> student. Ever since high school, 
                I‚Äôve been fascinated by computers and how technology shapes the way we live and work. 
                That curiosity grew stronger during senior high school, when, in our Empowerment Technology subject, 
                <strong>I led</strong> my group in creating an <strong>e-commerce website</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was the <strong>group leader</strong> and the <strong>lead programmer</strong> of the team. 
                I guided the project to success, and our website <a href="misc/luxwatch.html"><strong class="LuxWatch">"LuxWatch"</strong></a> was awarded 
                <strong>Best Website</strong> in our entire strand. That experience fueled my passion for IT and 
                ultimately inspired me to pursue this course. Today, I continue to build on that foundation 
                by learning not only programming and systems, but also how technology can be used 
                to solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy <strong>exploring</strong> new software tools, 
                <strong>tinkering</strong> with gadgets, and <strong>gaming</strong> with friends. 
                My goal is to develop my skills in both <strong>software development</strong> 
                and <strong>networking</strong>, so I can one day contribute to building 
                innovative solutions that make life easier for people. 
                I'm excited to learn and grow more throughout this course and to share ideas with all of you.
            </p>
