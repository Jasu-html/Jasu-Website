            <p><strong class="LuxWatch">LuxWatch</strong> is a mock-up e-commerce website developed in 2022 by <strong>Justin Alarcio</strong> 
              during his senior high school Empowerment Technology subject. The project was designed to replicate a luxury online watch store, 
              featuring world-renowned brands such as <strong>Rolex</strong>, <strong>Omega</strong>, <strong>TAG Heuer</strong>, and 
              <strong>Patek Philippe</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>Built using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, 
              LuxWatch demonstrated both technical skill and creative design, presenting a polished interface 
              that reflected the prestige of the products it showcased.
            </p>

            <p>As the group leader and lead programmer, Justin directed the project’s development and ensured its successful completion. 
              Under the evaluation of their IT instructor, <strong>Mr. Mark Gil Mifuel</strong>, LuxWatch was recognized with the 
              <strong>Best Website Award</strong> within their academic strand.
            </p>

            <p>This recognition not only highlighted Justin’s programming and leadership skills but also established a strong foundation 
              for his continuing journey in the field of <strong>Information Technology</strong>.

      <p class="disclaimer">This video serves as the only available showcase of the <strong class="LuxWatch">"LuxWatch"</strong></strong> project, as the original computer 
        used in its development is no longer functional. Please note that what you are seeing here is an early build 
        of the website, recorded before the final refinements were completed. Because of this, there may be a few visible bugs, 
        along with a user interface that appears less polished than the finished version. While it may not fully capture 
        the final product, the video still reflects the core features, design concept, and direction of the project. <span class="qoute">- Dev Team</span></p>
